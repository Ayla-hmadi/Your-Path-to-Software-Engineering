# Software Architecture Overview

## Introduction
Software architecture is the fundamental organization of a software system embodied in its components, their relationships to each other and the environment, and the principles guiding its design and evolution. This document provides a comprehensive overview of software architecture concepts, principles, and practices.

## Core Concepts

### What is Software Architecture?
Software architecture represents the high-level structure of a software system, consisting of:
- System components and their interfaces
- Component relationships and interactions
- Design decisions and constraints
- Quality attributes and trade-offs
- Evolution strategies

### Architectural Decisions
1. **Structure**
   - Component organization
   - System boundaries
   - Module relationships
   - Interface definitions
   - Data flow patterns

2. **Quality Attributes**
   - Performance
   - Scalability
   - Security
   - Maintainability
   - Reliability

## Architecture Dimensions

### Technical Architecture
1. **Application Architecture**
   - Component design

   - Service composition
   - Data structures
   - Integration patterns

2. **Infrastructure Architecture**
   - Deployment models
   - Network topology
   - Hardware requirements
   - System resources
   - Platform services

### Business Architecture
1. **Domain Architecture**
