# Configuration Management

## Introduction

Configuration Management (CM) is a systems engineering process for establishing and maintaining consistency of a product's performance, functional, and physical attributes with its requirements, design, and operational information throughout its life cycle.

## Core Components

### 1. Configuration Identification
- Asset inventory
- System components
- Dependencies mapping
- Version tracking
- Configuration items

### 2. Configuration Control
- Change management
- Version control
- Release management
- Baseline management
- Configuration auditing

### 3. Status Accounting
- Configuration tracking
- Change history
- Deployment status
- Audit trails
- Compliance reporting

### 4. Configuration Verification
- Compliance checking
- Performance validation
- Security verification
- Functionality testing
- Standards adherence

## Popular Configuration Management Tools

### 1. Ansible
```yaml
# Example Ansible playbook
---
- name: Configure web servers
  hosts: webservers
  become: yes
  
  tasks:
    - name: Install Apache
      apt:
        name: apache2
        state: present
        
    - name: Start Apache service
      service:
        name: apache2
        state: started
        enabled: yes
```

### 2. Chef
```ruby
# Example Chef recipe
package 'apache2' do
  action :install
end

service 'apache2' do
  action [:enable, :start]
end
```

### 3. Puppet
```puppet
# Example Puppet manifest
package { 'apache2':
  ensure => installed,
}

service { 'apache2':
  ensure => running,
  enable => true,
  require => Package['apache2'],
}
```

### 4. Salt
```yaml
# Example Salt state
apache:
  pkg.installed:
    - name: apache2
  service.running:
    - enable: True
    - require:
      - pkg: apache2
```
