# Continuous Monitoring

## Introduction

Continuous Monitoring is a critical DevOps practice that involves systematically observing, analyzing, and managing the operational health and security of systems in real-time. This document outlines the principles, practices, and tools for implementing effective monitoring strategies.

## Core Components

### 1. Infrastructure Monitoring
- Server health metrics
- Network performance
- Storage utilization
- Resource consumption
- Capacity planning

### 2. Application Monitoring
- Performance metrics
- Error rates
- Response times
- User experience
- Business metrics

### 3. Security Monitoring
- Access patterns
- Threat detection
- Compliance monitoring
- Security events
- Vulnerability scanning

### 4. Log Management
- Log collection
- Analysis
- Storage
- Retention
- Search capabilities

## Monitoring Strategies

### 1. Metrics Collection
```yaml
# Example Prometheus configuration
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s
  evaluation_interval: 15s

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'node'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:9100']

  - job_name: 'application'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:8080']
```

### 2. Alert Configuration
```yaml
# Example alert rules
groups:
- name: example
  rules:
  - alert: HighCPUUsage
    expr: node_cpu_usage_percent > 80
    for: 5m
    labels:
      severity: warning
    annotations:
      summary: High CPU usage detected
```

### 3. Dashboard Design
- Key metrics visibility
- Custom views
- Real-time updates
- Trend analysis
- Alert status

## Popular Monitoring Tools

  condition: "error_rate > 5%"
  duration: "5m"
  severity: "critical"
  notification:
    channels: ["slack", "email"]
    message: "Error rate exceeded threshold"
```

### 3. Notification Channels
