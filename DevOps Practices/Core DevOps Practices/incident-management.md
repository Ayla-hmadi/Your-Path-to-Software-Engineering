# Incident Management

## Introduction

Incident Management is the process of responding to and resolving unplanned interruptions or reductions in quality of IT services. This document outlines the principles, practices, and procedures for effective incident management in a DevOps environment.

## Incident Management Lifecycle

### 1. Detection
- Monitoring alerts
- User reports
- System notifications
- Automated detection
- Early warning systems

### 2. Response
- Initial assessment
- Team notification
- Resource allocation
- Communication initiation
- Immediate actions

### 3. Diagnosis
- Root cause analysis
- Impact assessment
- Service dependency mapping
- Problem identification
- Evidence collection

### 4. Resolution
- Solution implementation
- Testing and validation
- Service restoration
- Documentation
- Communication

### 5. Post-Incident
- Incident review
- Lessons learned
- Process improvements
- Documentation updates
- Training needs

## Incident Classification

### 1. Severity Levels
```yaml
# Example severity definitions
Severity:
  P1-Critical:
    description: "Complete service outage"
    response_time: "15 minutes"
    update_frequency: "30 minutes"
    
  P2-High:
    description: "Significant impact to service"
    response_time: "30 minutes"
    update_frequency: "2 hours"
    
  P3-Medium:
    description: "Minor service impact"
    response_time: "2 hours"
    update_frequency: "4 hours"
    
  P4-Low:
    description: "Minimal impact"
    response_time: "8 hours"
    update_frequency: "24 hours"
```

### 2. Impact Assessment
