# GitHub Actions

## Introduction

GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline directly from GitHub. This guide covers the setup, configuration, and best practices for implementing GitHub Actions.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Workflow Components
- Workflows
- Jobs
- Steps
- Actions
- Events
- Runners

### 2. Basic Structure
```yaml
# Example workflow structure
name: CI/CD Pipeline
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Step description
        uses: actions/specific-action@v1
```

## Workflow Configuration

### 1. Events and Triggers
```yaml
# Common trigger configurations
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * *'
  workflow_dispatch:
```

### 2. Jobs and Steps
```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '16'
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm test
```

## Common Workflow Templates

### 1. Node.js Application
```yaml
name: Node.js CI
on: [push]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [14.x, 16.x, 18.x]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run build --if-present
      - run: npm test
```

### 2. Docker Build and Push
```yaml
name: Docker Build
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Build and push Docker image
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v2
        with:
          push: true
          tags: user/app:latest
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Workflow Design
- Keep workflows focused
- Use reusable actions
- Implement proper error handling
- Include appropriate triggers
- Optimize for performance

### 2. Security
- Secret management
- Environment protection
- Permission settings
- Dependencies scanning
- Code scanning

### 3. Performance
- Caching strategies
- Artifact management
- Runner optimization
- Job concurrency
- Timeout settings

## Environment and Secrets

### 1. Environment Configuration
```yaml
name: Deploy
on: [push]
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: production
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Deploy to production
        env:
          API_KEY: ${{ secrets.API_KEY }}
        run: ./deploy.sh
```

### 2. Secret Management
- Repository secrets
- Environment secrets
- Organization secrets
- Encrypted secrets
- Secret rotation

## Matrix Builds

### 1. Configuration
```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node: [14, 16, 18]
        os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node }}
```

### 2. Optimization
- Parallel execution
- Failure conditions
- Include/exclude combinations
- Custom variables
- Reusable workflows

## Monitoring and Debugging

### 1. Workflow Monitoring
- Build status
- Job duration
- Resource usage
- Error tracking
- Performance metrics

### 2. Debug Logging
```yaml
# Enable debug logging
steps:
  - name: Enable debugging
    env:
      ACTIONS_RUNNER_DEBUG: true
      ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG: true
```

## Artifact Management

### 1. Upload Artifacts
```yaml
steps:
  - name: Upload build artifacts
    uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
    with:
      name: dist
      path: dist/
```

### 2. Download Artifacts
```yaml
steps:
  - name: Download artifacts
    uses: actions/download-artifact@v2
    with:
      name: dist
```

## Custom Actions

### 1. JavaScript Action
```yaml
# action.yml
name: 'Custom Action'
description: 'Description of action'
inputs:
  who-to-greet:
    description: 'Who to greet'
    required: true
    default: 'World'
runs:
  using: 'node16'
  main: 'index.js'
```

### 2. Docker Action
```yaml
# action.yml
name: 'Docker Action'
description: 'Run in Docker'
runs:
  using: 'docker'
  image: 'Dockerfile'
```

## Integration with Other Tools

### 1. Code Quality Tools
```yaml
jobs:
  quality:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: SonarCloud Scan
        uses: SonarSource/sonarcloud-github-action@master
```

### 2. Deployment Platforms
```yaml
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: azure/webapps-deploy@v2
        with:
          app-name: myapp
          publish-profile: ${{ secrets.AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE }}
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

### 1. Common Issues
- Build failures
- Runner problems
- Secret access
- Permission errors
- Network issues

### 2. Resolution Steps
- Check logs
- Verify configurations
- Test locally
- Review permissions
