# GitLab CI/CD

## Introduction

GitLab CI/CD is an integrated continuous integration and delivery platform within GitLab. This guide covers the setup, configuration, and best practices for implementing GitLab CI/CD in your projects.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Basic Components
- Pipelines
- Jobs
- Stages
- Runners
- Variables
- Artifacts

### 2. Configuration Structure
```yaml
# Basic .gitlab-ci.yml structure
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

variables:
  VARIABLE_NAME: "value"

job_name:
  stage: build
  script:
    - command
```

## Pipeline Configuration

### 1. Basic Pipeline
```yaml
# Example .gitlab-ci.yml
image: node:16

stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

build:
  stage: build
  script:
    - npm install
    - npm run build
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - dist/

test:
  stage: test
  script:
    - npm run test

deploy:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - ./deploy.sh
  only:
    - main
```

### 2. Advanced Features
```yaml
# Advanced configuration
job:
  stage: test
  before_script:
    - setup_command
  script:
    - test_command
  after_script:
    - cleanup_command
  rules:
    - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == "main"
      when: always
  cache:
    paths:
      - node_modules/
```

## Job Configuration

### 1. Job Types
```yaml
# Different job types
build_job:
  stage: build
  script:
    - make build

parallel_job:
  parallel: 3
  script:
    - run_tests.sh

manual_job:
  when: manual
  script:
    - deploy.sh
```

### 2. Dependencies
```yaml
job2:
  stage: test
  dependencies:
    - job1
  needs:
    - job1
  script:
    - test_command
```

## Environment Configuration

### 1. Environment Variables
```yaml
variables:
  GLOBAL_VAR: "value"

job:
  variables:
    JOB_VAR: "value"
  script:
    - echo $GLOBAL_VAR
    - echo $JOB_VAR
```

### 2. Environments
```yaml
deploy_staging:
  stage: deploy
  environment:
    name: staging
    url: https://staging.example.com
  script:
    - deploy_to_staging.sh
```

## Runner Configuration

### 1. Runner Types
- Shared runners
- Specific runners
- Group runners
- Instance runners

### 2. Runner Tags
```yaml
job:
  tags:
    - docker
    - linux
  script:
    - execute_command
```

## Cache and Artifacts

### 1. Cache Configuration
```yaml
cache:
  key: ${CI_COMMIT_REF_SLUG}
  paths:
    - node_modules/
    - .npm/
```

### 2. Artifacts Management
```yaml
job:
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - build/
    reports:
      junit: test-results.xml
    expire_in: 1 week
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Pipeline Design
- Keep pipelines simple
- Use stages effectively
- Implement caching
- Optimize artifact handling
- Maintain job independence

### 2. Security
- Secret management
- Protected variables
- Secure runners
- Access controls
- Dependency scanning

### 3. Performance
- Cache optimization
- Runner configuration
- Job parallelization
- Resource allocation
- Timeout settings

## Advanced Features

### 1. Multi-Project Pipelines
```yaml
trigger_job:
  trigger:
    project: group/project
    branch: main
    strategy: depend
```

### 2. Include Templates
```yaml
include:
  - template: Security/SAST.gitlab-ci.yml
  - local: /templates/build.yml
  - remote: https://gitlab.com/company/templates/raw/main/ci.yml
```

## Testing Strategies

### 1. Unit Testing
```yaml
unit_tests:
  stage: test
  script:
    - npm run test:unit
  coverage: '/Coverage: \d+\.\d+/'
```

### 2. Integration Testing
```yaml
integration_tests:
  stage: test
  services:
    - mysql:5.7
  script:
    - npm run test:integration
```

## Deployment Configuration

### 1. Staging Deployment
```yaml
deploy_staging:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - deploy_to_staging.sh
  environment:
    name: staging
  only:
    - develop
```

### 2. Production Deployment
```yaml
deploy_production:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - deploy_to_production.sh
  environment:
    name: production
  when: manual
  only:
    - main
```

## Monitoring and Metrics

### 1. Pipeline Metrics
- Success rate
- Duration
- Coverage
- Performance
- Resource usage

### 2. Job Metrics
- Execution time
- Runner utilization
- Cache effectiveness
- Artifact size
- Error rates

## Troubleshooting Guide

### 1. Common Issues
- Pipeline failures
- Runner problems
- Cache issues
- Artifact errors
- Variable conflicts

### 2. Resolution Steps
- Check logs
- Verify configuration
- Test locally
- Check permissions
- Update dependencies

## Security Scanning

### 1. SAST Configuration
```yaml
include:
  - template: Security/SAST.gitlab-ci.yml

sast:
  variables:
    SAST_EXCLUDED_PATHS: "spec, test, tests, tmp"
```

### 2. Container Scanning
```yaml
include:
  - template: Security/Container-Scanning.gitlab-ci.yml

container_scanning:
  variables:
    CS_DEFAULT_BRANCH_IMAGE: $CI_REGISTRY_IMAGE:$CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH
```
