# Security in DevOps (DevSecOps)

## Introduction

DevSecOps integrates security practices within the DevOps process, ensuring that security is considered from the beginning of the development lifecycle rather than being an afterthought.

## Core Security Principles

### 1. Shift-Left Security
- Early security integration
- Security as code
- Automated security testing
- Continuous security monitoring
- Proactive vulnerability management
- Security requirements in planning

### 2. Security Automation
```yaml
# Example security automation workflow
pipeline:
  security_checks:
    - static_analysis
    - dependency_scanning
    - container_scanning
    - dynamic_analysis
    - compliance_checks
    
  automated_responses:
    - vulnerability_alerts
    - patch_management
    - access_control_updates
    - security_logging
```

## Security Implementation

### 1. Code Security
```python
# Example secure coding practices
def secure_function(user_input):
    # Input validation
    if not validate_input(user_input):
        raise ValidationError("Invalid input")
        
    # Parameterized queries
    query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = %s"
    cursor.execute(query, (user_input,))
    
    # Output encoding
    return html.escape(result)
```

### 2. Infrastructure Security
```hcl
# Terraform security configuration
resource "aws_security_group" "web" {
  name = "web-security-group"
  
  ingress {
    from_port   = 443
    to_port     = 443
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
  
  egress {
    from_port   = 0
    to_port     = 0
    protocol    = "-1"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
  
  tags = {
    Environment = "production"
    Security    = "high"
  }
}
```

## Security Testing

### 1. Static Analysis
```yaml
# SAST configuration
sast:
  analyzer:
    - sonarqube
    - checkmarx
    - fortify
  rules:
    - sql_injection
    - xss
    - csrf
    - auth_bypass
  actions:
    - block_on_high_severity
    - alert_on_medium
    - log_all_findings
```

### 2. Dynamic Analysis
```yaml
# DAST configuration
dast:
  scanner: zap
  target: https://example.com
  rules:
    - active_scan
    - passive_scan
    - api_scan
  schedule:
    - daily_scan
    - post_deployment
```

## Access Control

### 1. Identity Management
```yaml
# IAM configuration
roles:
  developer:
    permissions:
      - read_code
      - write_code
      - run_tests
    restrictions:
      - no_production_access
      - no_customer_data
      
  operator:
    permissions:
      - deploy_code
      - monitor_systems
      - manage_infrastructure
    restrictions:
      - no_customer_data_modification
```

### 2. Secret Management
```yaml
# Vault configuration
vault:
  auth_methods:
    - kubernetes
    - ldap
    - aws_iam
    
  secret_engines:
    - kv:
        path: secret/
        version: 2
    - database:
        path: db/
    - aws:
        path: aws/
        
  policies:
    - name: app-policy
      rules: |
        path "secret/data/app/*" {
          capabilities = ["read"]
        }
```

## Compliance and Auditing

### 1. Compliance Checks
```yaml
# Compliance configuration
compliance:
  standards:
    - SOC2
    - ISO27001
    - GDPR
    - HIPAA
    
  checks:
    - data_encryption
    - access_logs
    - security_updates
    - password_policy
    
  reporting:
    frequency: weekly
    format: pdf
    distribution: security_team
```

### 2. Audit Logging
```json
{
  "audit_config": {
    "log_types": [
      "authentication",
      "authorization",
      "data_access",
      "system_changes"
    ],
    "retention": {
      "period": "365 days",
      "storage": "secure_bucket"
    },
    "alerts": {
      "unauthorized_access": "immediate",
      "system_changes": "daily_summary"
    }
  }

      notification: "immediate"
      team: "security_team"
    
    medium:
      response_time: "4 hours"
      notification: "next_business_day"

```

### 2. Recovery Procedures

      "application_logs",
      "network_traffic",
