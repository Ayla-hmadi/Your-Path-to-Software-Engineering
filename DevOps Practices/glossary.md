# DevOps Glossary

A comprehensive glossary of key terms and concepts commonly used in DevOps practices.

## A

**Agile**
: A software development methodology emphasizing iterative development, cross-functional collaboration, and continuous feedback.

**Artifact**
: Any element produced and stored during the software development process (e.g., compiled code, packages, container images).

**Automated Testing**
: The process of running pre-defined tests automatically to verify code quality and functionality.

## B

**Blue-Green Deployment**
: A deployment strategy using two identical environments, allowing quick rollback if issues occur.

**Branching**
: The practice of creating copies of source code for parallel development and feature isolation.

## C

**Canary Deployment**
: A deployment strategy where changes are gradually rolled out to a small subset of users before full deployment.

**CI/CD**
: Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (or Deployment) - automated processes for integrating, testing, and deploying code changes.

**Configuration Management**
: The process of maintaining systems, servers, and software in a desired state.

**Container**
: A lightweight, standalone package containing everything needed to run a piece of software.

## D

**Deployment Pipeline**
: An automated sequence of steps that code changes go through from development to production.

**DevSecOps**
: Integration of security practices within the DevOps process.

**Docker**
: A platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers.

## E

**Environment**
: A set of hardware and software configurations where applications run (e.g., development, staging, production).

**Epic**
: A large body of work that can be broken down into smaller user stories.

## F

**Feature Flag**
: A software development technique that turns functionality on/off without deploying new code.

**Five Nines**
: A measure of system reliability targeting 99.999% uptime.

## G

**Git**
: A distributed version control system for tracking changes in source code.

**Golden Image**
: A template for a virtual machine, container, or server configuration.

## H

**High Availability (HA)**
: System design ensuring a certain degree of operational continuity.

**Helm**
: A package manager for Kubernetes applications.

## I

**Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**
: Managing and provisioning infrastructure through code rather than manual processes.

**Integration Testing**
: Testing how different parts of an application work together.

## K

**Kubernetes**
: An open-source container orchestration platform.

**KPI (Key Performance Indicator)**
: Metrics used to evaluate the success of DevOps practices.

## L

**Load Balancing**
: Distribution of workloads across multiple computing resources.

**Log Aggregation**
: Collecting and storing logs from multiple sources in a central location.

## M

**Microservices**
: An architectural style structuring applications as collections of loosely coupled services.

**Monitoring**
: Continuous observation of system performance and health.

## O

**Orchestration**
: Automated configuration, management, and coordination of computer systems and software.

## P

**Pipeline**
: An automated series of tools and processes for delivering software.

**Pod**
: The smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes.

## R

**Release Management**
: The process of managing, planning, scheduling, and controlling software releases.

**Rolling Deployment**
: Gradually updating instances of an application to a new version.

## S

**Scaling**
: Adjusting resources to meet changing demand.

**Service Level Agreement (SLA)**
: A commitment between a service provider and client about service quality.

**Source Control**
: Management of changes to documents, programs, and other information stored as computer files.

## T

**Technical Debt**
: The implied cost of additional rework caused by choosing a limited solution now instead of a better approach that would take longer.

**Telemetry**
: Collection and transmission of performance data from distributed systems.

## U

**Unit Testing**
: Testing individual components or functions of software.

**Uptime**
: The amount of time a system is operational and available.

## V

**Version Control**
: System for tracking and managing changes to software code.

**Virtual Machine (VM)**
: An emulation of a computer system providing functionality of a physical computer.

## W

**Webhook**
: Automated messages sent from apps when something happens.

**Workflow**
: A sequence of steps describing how work should be done.
