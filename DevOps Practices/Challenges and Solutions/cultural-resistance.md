# Cultural Resistance to DevOps

## Introduction

Cultural resistance is often cited as one of the biggest challenges in DevOps adoption. This guide addresses common sources of resistance and provides strategies for successful cultural transformation.

## Understanding Resistance

### 1. Common Sources
```yaml
resistance_sources:
  organizational:
    - Fear of job loss
    - Comfort with status quo
    - Historical silos
    - Traditional processes
    - Lack of trust
    
  individual:
    - Skill gaps
    - Role uncertainty
    - Change fatigue
    - Past experiences
    - Comfort zones
```

### 2. Impact Assessment
```python
# Example resistance impact evaluation
def assess_resistance_impact():
    impact_areas = {
        'productivity': measure_productivity_impact(),
        'morale': evaluate_team_morale(),
        'adoption_rate': calculate_adoption_rate(),
        'collaboration': measure_collaboration_level(),
        'innovation': assess_innovation_impact()
    }
    return calculate_overall_impact(impact_areas)
```
