# Software Testing Overview

## Introduction
Software testing is a critical component of software development that ensures the quality, reliability, and performance of applications. This document provides a comprehensive overview of software testing principles, methodologies, and practices.

## What is Software Testing?
Software testing is the process of evaluating and verifying that a software product or application does what it is supposed to do. It involves executing a program or system with the intent of finding errors or gaps between expected and actual results.

## Importance of Testing
- **Quality Assurance**: Ensures software meets specified requirements
- **Bug Prevention**: Early detection and prevention of defects
- **Cost Efficiency**: Reduces maintenance and support costs
- **User Satisfaction**: Improves end-user experience
- **Risk Mitigation**: Identifies potential risks before deployment
- **Compliance**: Ensures adherence to standards and regulations

## Testing Lifecycle
1. **Test Planning**
   - Define testing scope and objectives
   - Create test strategy
   - Identify required resources

2. **Test Analysis**
   - Review requirements
   - Create test conditions
   - Identify test data needs

3. **Test Design**
   - Create test cases
   - Develop test scripts
   - Prepare test data

4. **Test Execution**
   - Run tests
   - Document results
   - Report defects

5. **Test Closure**
   - Analyze test results
   - Create test summary reports
   - Document lessons learned

- **Unit Tests**: Base layer, testing individual components
- **Integration/API Tests**: Middle layer, testing component interactions
- **UI/End-to-End Tests**: Top layer, testing complete workflows

## Testing Types

### Functional Testing
