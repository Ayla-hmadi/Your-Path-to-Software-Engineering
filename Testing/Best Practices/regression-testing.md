# Regression Testing Guide

## Overview

### Fundamentals
```yaml
Definition:
  Type of testing that verifies previously working features
  still function after code changes, updates, or enhancements

Purpose:
  - Detect unintended changes
  - Ensure stability
  - Maintain quality
  - Prevent regressions
```

### Key Concepts
```yaml
Testing Scope:
  - Existing functionality
  - Core features
  - Critical paths
  - Integration points

Focus Areas:
  - Changed components
  - Affected areas
  - Related features
  - System stability
```

## Strategy Development

### Test Selection
```yaml
Selection Criteria:
  Priority-based:
    - Critical features
    - High-risk areas
    - Frequently used paths
    - Recent changes

  Risk-based:
    - Business impact
    - Technical complexity
    - Change frequency
    - Integration dependencies
```

### Test Approach
```yaml
Testing Methods:
  Full Regression:
    - Complete test suite
    - All features
    - Full coverage
    
  Partial Regression:
    - Impact analysis
    - Selected tests
    - Focused scope
```

## Implementation
