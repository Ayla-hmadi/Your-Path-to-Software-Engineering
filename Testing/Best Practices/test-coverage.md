# Test Coverage Guide

## Coverage Fundamentals

### Basic Concepts
```yaml
Coverage Types:
  Code Coverage:
    - Line coverage
    - Branch coverage
    - Function coverage
    - Statement coverage
    
  Feature Coverage:
    - Requirement coverage
    - Scenario coverage
    - Use case coverage
    - Business flow coverage
```

### Coverage Metrics
```yaml
Key Metrics:
  Statement Coverage:
    formula: (executed statements / total statements) * 100
    target: >80%
    
  Branch Coverage:
    formula: (executed branches / total branches) * 100
    target: >70%
    
  Function Coverage:
    formula: (executed functions / total functions) * 100
    target: >90%
```

## Implementation

### Code Coverage Tools
```yaml
Tool Categories:
  Unit Testing:
    - Jest Coverage
    - JaCoCo
    - Coverage.py
    - Istanbul
    
  Integration Testing:
    - Cobertura
    - Clover
    - OpenCover
    - CodeCov
```

### Configuration
```javascript
// Jest configuration example
module.exports = {
  collectCoverage: true,
  coverageDirectory: "coverage",
  coverageThreshold: {
    global: {
      branches: 80,
      functions: 80,
      lines: 80,
      statements: 80
    }
  },
  coverageReporters: [
    "text",
    "html",
    "lcov"
  ]
}
```

## Coverage Analysis

### Coverage Assessment
