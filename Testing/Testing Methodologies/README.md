# Testing Methodologies Overview

## Core Methodologies

### Black Box Testing
```yaml
Definition:
  Testing without knowledge of internal code implementation

Focus Areas:
  - Functionality testing
  - Interface testing
  - Input/Output validation
  - User experience

Application:
  - System testing
  - Acceptance testing
  - Integration testing
  - User interface testing
```

### White Box Testing
```yaml
Definition:
  Testing with full knowledge of internal code implementation

Focus Areas:
  - Code coverage
  - Path testing
  - Branch testing
  - Statement testing

Application:
  - Unit testing
  - Integration testing
  - Security testing
  - Performance optimization
```

### Gray Box Testing
```yaml
Definition:
  Testing with partial knowledge of internal workings

Focus Areas:
  - Integration points
  - Data flow
  - Error handling
  - Behavioral testing

Application:
  - Integration testing
  - Security testing
  - Database testing
  - API testing
```

## Testing Approaches

### Static Testing
```yaml
Methods:
  Reviews:
    - Code review
    - Design review
    - Documentation review
    
  Analysis:
    - Static code analysis
    - Complexity analysis
    - Security scanning
```

### Dynamic Testing
```yaml
Methods:
  Functional:
    - Behavior testing
    - Feature validation
    - Integration testing
    
  Non-functional:
    - Performance testing
    - Security testing
    - Load testing
```

## Testing Strategies

### Risk-Based Testing
```yaml
Components:
  Risk Assessment:
    - Impact analysis
    - Probability evaluation
    - Priority setting
    
  Test Planning:
    - Resource allocation
    - Test coverage
    - Execution strategy
```

### Requirement-Based Testing
```yaml
Implementation:
  Coverage:
    - Functional requirements
    - Non-functional requirements
    - Business rules
    
  Validation:
    - Requirement traceability
    - Acceptance criteria
    - Test coverage mapping
```

## Testing Techniques

### Equivalence Partitioning
```yaml
Process:
  - Input classification
  - Value range grouping
  - Boundary identification
  - Test case selection

Benefits:
  - Reduced test cases
  - Efficient coverage
  - Systematic approach
  - Clear organization
```

### Boundary Value Analysis
```yaml
Implementation:
  Test Cases:
    - Minimum values
    - Maximum values
    - Edge cases
    - Invalid boundaries
    
  Coverage:
    - Input boundaries
    - Output ranges
    - Data limits
    - System constraints
```

## Test Design Methods

### State Transition Testing
```yaml
Elements:
  States:
    - Initial conditions
    - Transitions
    - End states
    
  Coverage:
    - State paths
    - Transition pairs
    - Invalid transitions
```

### Decision Table Testing
```yaml
Components:
  Table Elements:
    - Conditions
    - Actions
    - Rules
    - Outcomes
    
  Analysis:
    - Condition combinations
    - Expected results
    - Test coverage
```

## Test Execution

### Sequential Testing
```yaml
Process Flow:
  1. Test preparation
  2. Environment setup
  3. Test execution
  4. Result validation

Management:
  - Test sequence
  - Dependency handling
  - Progress tracking
  - Result documentation
```

### Parallel Testing
```yaml
Implementation:
  Execution:
    - Concurrent tests
    - Resource allocation
    - Synchronization
    
  Management:
    - Test isolation
    - Resource scheduling
    - Result aggregation
```

## Best Practices
