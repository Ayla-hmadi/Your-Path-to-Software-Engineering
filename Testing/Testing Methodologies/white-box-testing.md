# White Box Testing

## Overview

### Definition
```yaml
Description:
  Testing technique that examines internal logic of the software system

Key Characteristics:
  - Code-based testing
  - Internal structure focus
  - Logic path validation
  - Implementation testing

Purpose:
  - Verify code paths
  - Validate logic flows
