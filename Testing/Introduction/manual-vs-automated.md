# Manual vs Automated Testing

## Overview of Testing Approaches

### Manual Testing
```yaml
Definition:
  Human execution of test cases without scripting or automation tools

Characteristics:
  - Direct human interaction
  - Real-world validation
  - Flexible execution
  - Intuitive testing

Key Uses:
  - Exploratory testing
  - Usability testing
  - Ad-hoc testing
  - Visual verification
```

### Automated Testing
```yaml
Definition:
  Test execution using scripts and automation tools

Characteristics:
  - Script-driven execution
  - Repeatable process
  - Tool dependency
  - High-speed execution

Key Uses:
  - Regression testing
  - Performance testing
  - Load testing
  - Continuous integration
```

## Comparison Factors

### Cost Considerations
```yaml
