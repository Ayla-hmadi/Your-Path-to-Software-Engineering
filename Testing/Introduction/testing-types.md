# Types of Software Testing

## Unit Testing

### Overview
```yaml
Definition:
  Testing of individual components or functions in isolation

Characteristics:
  - Small scope
  - Fast execution
  - Automated
  - Developer-focused

Purpose:
  - Verify component behavior
  - Validate logic
  - Ensure code quality
  - Early bug detection
```

### Implementation
```yaml
Common Practices:
  - Test-Driven Development (TDD)
  - Isolation through mocking
  - Extensive automation
  - Continuous testing

Tools:
  JavaScript:
    - Jest
    - Mocha
  Java:
    - JUnit
    - TestNG
  Python:
    - pytest
    - unittest
```

## Integration Testing

### Overview
```yaml
Definition:
  Testing of interactions between components or systems

Scope:
  - Component integration
  - Service interaction
  - API testing
  - Database integration

Objectives:
  - Verify interfaces
  - Test data flow
  - Validate dependencies
  - Check communication
```

### Implementation Approaches
```yaml
Testing Methods:
  Bottom-up:
    - Start with lowest components
    - Gradually integrate upward
    - Build complex interactions
  
  Top-down:
    - Start with high-level modules
    - Progress to details
    - Use stubs for dependencies
  
  Sandwich/Hybrid:
    - Combine both approaches
    - Parallel integration
    - Maximum coverage
```

## System Testing

### Overview
```yaml
Definition:
  Complete end-to-end testing of the entire system

Types:
  - Functional testing
  - Performance testing
  - Security testing
  - Usability testing
  - Compatibility testing

Goals:
  - Validate full system
  - Verify requirements
  - Test real scenarios
  - Ensure quality
```

### Key Areas
```yaml
Testing Focus:
  Functionality:
    - Feature testing
    - Workflow validation
    - Error handling
    - Business rules
    
  Non-functional:
    - Performance
    - Security
    - Scalability
    - Reliability
```

## Acceptance Testing

### Overview
```yaml
Definition:
  Validation that the system meets business requirements

Types:
  - User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
  - Business Acceptance Testing
  - Alpha/Beta Testing
  - Contract Acceptance Testing

Purpose:
  - Verify business value
  - Validate usability
  - Confirm requirements
  - Ensure readiness
```

### Implementation Methods
```yaml
Testing Approaches:
  Alpha Testing:
    - Internal testing
    - Controlled environment
    - Pre-release validation
  
  Beta Testing:
    - External users
    - Real environment
    - User feedback
    
  UAT:
    - Business validation
    - Stakeholder approval
    - Process verification
```

## Specialized Testing Types

### Performance Testing
```yaml
Categories:
  Load Testing:
    - System under load
    - Concurrent users
    - Resource usage
    
  Stress Testing:
    - System limits
    - Breaking points
    - Recovery testing
    
  Endurance Testing:
    - Long-term stability
    - Memory leaks
    - Resource degradation
```

### Security Testing
```yaml
Areas:
  Vulnerability Assessment:
    - Security scanning
    - Penetration testing
    - Risk assessment
    
  Security Compliance:
    - Standards compliance
    - Policy enforcement
    - Access control
```

## Test Implementation

### Test Planning
```yaml
Planning Elements:
  - Test strategy
  - Resource allocation
  - Tool selection
  - Schedule planning

Considerations:
  - Risk assessment
  - Priority setting
  - Coverage requirements
  - Resource constraints
```

### Test Organization
```yaml
Structure:
  Test Suites:
    - Logical grouping
    - Progressive complexity
    - Clear organization
    
  Test Cases:
    - Clear objectives
    - Reproducible steps
    - Expected results
    - Validation criteria
```

## Best Practices
