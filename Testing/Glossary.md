# Software Testing Glossary

A comprehensive glossary of terms commonly used in software testing.

## A

**Acceptance Testing**  
Testing performed to determine whether a system satisfies its acceptance criteria and enables the user to accept the system.

**Automated Testing**  
The use of software to execute tests, compare actual outcomes to predicted outcomes, set up test preconditions, and other test control and test reporting functions.

## B

**Black Box Testing**  
Testing method where the internal workings of the item being tested are not known to the tester.

**Bug**  
A defect or flaw in a software system that causes it to behave in unintended ways.

## C

**Code Coverage**  
A measure of how much of the source code is exercised during test execution.

**Continuous Integration (CI)**  
Development practice where developers integrate code into a shared repository frequently, and each integration is verified by automated tests.

## D

**Defect**  
A flaw in a component or system that can cause it to fail to perform its required function.

**Dynamic Testing**  
Testing that involves the execution of the software being tested.

## E

**End-to-End Testing**  
Testing methodology that verifies the flow of an application from start to finish.

**Exploratory Testing**  
Simultaneous learning, test design, and test execution.

## F

**Functional Testing**  
Testing conducted to evaluate the compliance of a system or component with specified functional requirements.

**Flaky Test**  
A test that sometimes passes and sometimes fails without any code changes.

## G

**Gray Box Testing**  
Testing method which combines elements of both black box and white box testing.

## I

**Integration Testing**  
Testing performed to expose defects in the interfaces and interaction between integrated components.

## L

**Load Testing**  
Testing that determines a system's behavior under both normal and anticipated peak load conditions.

## M

**Mock Object**  
A simulated object that mimics the behavior of real objects in controlled ways.

## N

**Non-Functional Testing**  
Testing of software attributes that are not related to functionality (e.g., reliability, efficiency, usability).

## P

**Performance Testing**  
Testing conducted to evaluate how fast a system or component responds.

**Production Bug**  
A defect found after the software has been deployed to production.

## R

**Regression Testing**  
Testing of a previously tested program following modification to ensure that defects have not been introduced in unchanged areas.

**Risk-Based Testing**  
Testing prioritized based on identified risks and technical/business importance.

## S

**Smoke Testing**  
Basic tests to check if the main functions of a piece of software work.

**Static Testing**  
Testing of software work products without code execution.

## T

**Test Automation Framework**  
A set of guidelines, practices, and tools for implementing and designing test cases.

**Test Case**  
A set of conditions under which a tester will determine whether a system satisfies requirements.

**Test Driven Development (TDD)**  
Development approach where tests are written before the code.

**Test Environment**  
Setup of hardware, software, and network configuration where tests are executed.

**Test Plan**  
A document describing the scope, approach, resources, and schedule of intended test activities.

**Test Suite**  
A collection of test cases intended to test a software program.

## U

**Unit Testing**  
Testing of individual software components or modules.

**Usability Testing**  
Testing to determine the extent to which the software is user-friendly.

## V

**Validation**  
Confirmation that the requirements for a specific intended use or application have been fulfilled.

**Verification**  
Confirmation that specified requirements have been fulfilled.

## W

**White Box Testing**  
Testing based on an analysis of the internal logic of the software component.
