# Handling Flaky Tests

## Understanding Flaky Tests

### Definition
```yaml
Characteristics:
  - Inconsistent results
  - Non-deterministic behavior
  - Same code, different outcomes
  - Intermittent failures

Impact:
  - Reduced test reliability
  - False positives/negatives
  - Wasted resources
  - Delayed releases
```

### Common Causes
```yaml
Timing Issues:
  - Race conditions
  - Async operations
  - Timeouts
  - Animation delays

Environmental Factors:
  - Resource availability
  - Network conditions
  - System state
  - External dependencies
```

## Identification

### Detection Methods
```yaml
Automated Detection:
  - Test result analysis
  - Pattern recognition
  - Historical data
  - Failure frequency

Manual Analysis:
  - Code review
  - Execution monitoring
  - Log analysis
  - Behavior observation
```

### Classification
```yaml
Categories:
  Infrastructure:
    - Environment issues
    - Resource problems
    - Network issues
    
  Application:
    - Race conditions
    - State management
    - Data dependencies
    
  Test Design:
    - Poor isolation
    - Timing assumptions
    - Resource conflicts
```

## Resolution Strategies

### Immediate Actions
```yaml

  - Shared state
  - External dependencies
  - Hard-coded waits
```

### Environment Management
```yaml
Management Strategies:
  - Clean state before tests
  - Isolated environments
  - Controlled resources
  - Independent data
  
Implementation:
  - Setup scripts
  - Cleanup procedures
  - State verification
  - Resource monitoring
```

## Monitoring and Analysis

### Test Metrics
```yaml
Key Indicators:
  - Failure frequency
  - Pattern analysis
  - Resource usage
  - Execution time
  
Tracking:
  - Historical data
  - Trend analysis
  - Impact assessment
  - Success rate
```

### Result Analysis
```yaml
Analysis Process:
  Data Collection:
    - Test results
    - Execution logs
    - Resource metrics
    - Error patterns
    
  Evaluation:
    - Pattern identification
    - Root cause analysis
    - Impact assessment
    - Solution validation
```
