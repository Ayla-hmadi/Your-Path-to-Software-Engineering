# Branching Strategies Guide

## Overview
A branching strategy defines how an organization manages different branches in version control to support multiple parallel development streams while maintaining code stability and quality.

## Common Strategies

### Git Flow
1. **Main Branches**
   ```
   main    - Production code
   develop - Development code
   ```

2. **Supporting Branches**
   ```
   feature/* - New features
   release/* - Release preparation
   hotfix/*  - Emergency fixes
   ```

3. **Flow Pattern**
   ```
   feature  → develop → release → main
   hotfix   → main + develop
   ```

### Trunk-Based Development
1. **Core Concept**
   ```
   main     - Single source of truth
   feature/* - Short-lived branches
   ```

2. **Characteristics**
   ```
   - Small, frequent changes
   - Continuous integration
   - Feature flags
   - Quick merges
   ```

### GitHub Flow
1. **Structure**
   ```
   main     - Production-ready code
   feature/* - All changes
   ```

2. **Process**
   ```
   1. Branch from main
   2. Add commits
   3. Open pull request
   4. Review and discuss
   5. Deploy and test
   6. Merge to main
   ```

## Strategy Selection

### Factors to Consider
1. **Team Size**
   ```
   Small Teams:
   - Simpler workflows
   - Direct communication
   - Quick iterations

   Large Teams:
   - Structured processes
   - Clear protocols
   - Coordination tools
   ```

2. **Release Cycle**
   ```
   Continuous Delivery:
   - Trunk-based development
   - Feature flags
   - Automated testing

   Scheduled Releases:
   - Git Flow
   - Release branches
   - Staged deployments
   ```

### Implementation Guidelines

1. **Documentation**
   ```
   - Branch naming conventions
   - Workflow diagrams
   - Process documentation
   - Team guidelines
   ```

2. **Tools and Automation**
   ```
   - Branch protection
   - Automated testing
   - Code review tools
   - Deployment pipelines
   ```

## Branch Types

### Long-Running Branches
1. **Main/Master**
   ```
   Purpose:
   - Production code
   - Release history
   - Version tags
   
   Protection:
   - Required reviews
   - CI/CD checks
   - Limited access
   ```

2. **Development**
   ```
   Purpose:
   - Integration branch
   - Feature collection
   - Pre-release testing
   
   Management:
   - Regular updates
   - Feature integration
   - Quality checks
   ```

### Short-Lived Branches
1. **Feature Branches**
   ```
   Naming:
   feature/<issue-id>-description
   feature/user-authentication
   
   Lifecycle:
   1. Create from base
   2. Develop feature
   3. Review and test
   4. Merge and delete
   ```

2. **Hotfix Branches**
   ```
   Naming:
   hotfix/<issue-id>-description
   hotfix/security-vulnerability
   
   Process:
   1. Branch from main
   2. Fix issue
   3. Test thoroughly
   4. Merge to main/develop
   ```

## Branch Management

### Naming Conventions
```
Format:
<type>/<issue-id>-<description>

Examples:
feature/AUTH-123-login-page
bugfix/CORE-456-memory-leak
hotfix/SEC-789-xss-vulnerability
```

### Protection Rules
1. **Branch Restrictions**
   ```
   Protected Branches:
   - No direct pushes
   - Required reviews
   - Status checks
   - Linear history
   ```

2. **Merge Requirements**
   ```
   - Clean CI builds
   - Code review approval
   - Updated documentation
   - Passing tests
   ```

## Integration Practices

### Merge Strategies
1. **Regular Merge**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge --no-ff feature-branch
   ```

2. **Squash Merge**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge --squash feature-branch
   git commit -m "Feature: Description"
   ```

### Conflict Resolution
1. **Prevention**
   ```
   - Regular updates
   - Small changes
   - Clear ownership
   - Communication
   ```

2. **Resolution Process**
   ```
   1. Identify conflicts
   2. Understand changes
   3. Resolve carefully
   4. Test thoroughly
   ```

## Best Practices

### Branch Lifecycle
1. **Creation**
   ```
   - Clear purpose
   - Updated base
   - Proper naming
   - Linked issues
   ```

2. **Maintenance**
   ```
   - Regular updates
   - Clean commits
   - Clear documentation
   - Timely merges
   ```

3. **Cleanup**
   ```
   - Prompt deletion
   - Archive references
   - Update documentation
   - Clean remotes
   ```

### Quality Control
1. **Code Review**
   ```
   - Style compliance
   - Design review
   - Security check
   - Performance analysis
   ```

2. **Testing Requirements**
   ```
   - Unit tests
   - Integration tests
   - Performance tests
   - Security scans
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Merge Conflicts**
   ```
   Prevention:
   - Regular rebasing
   - Small changes
   - Clear communication
   
   Resolution:
   - Understand context
   - Careful merging
   - Thorough testing
   ```

2. **Branch Management**
   ```
   Issues:
   - Stale branches
   - Missing updates
   - Wrong base
   
   Solutions:
   - Regular cleanup
   - Update protocols
   - Base verification
   ```

### Recovery Procedures
1. **Lost Changes**
   ```
   git reflog
   git checkout -b recovery-branch <commit>
   ```

2. **Wrong Merges**
   ```
   git revert <merge-commit>
   git reset --hard <previous-commit>
   ```
