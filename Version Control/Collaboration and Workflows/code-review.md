## Review Guidelines

### For Reviewers

#### Technical Focus
```markdown
1. Architecture
   - Design patterns
   - Component interaction
   - System integration
   - Scalability concerns
   
2. Implementation
   - Algorithm choice
   - Data structures
   - Library usage
   - Code efficiency
   
3. Testing
   - Test coverage
   - Test cases
   - Edge cases
   - Integration tests
```

#### Non-Technical Focus
```markdown
1. Documentation
   - Code comments
   - API documentation
   - README updates
   - Change logs
   
2. Style
   - Naming conventions
   - Formatting
   - Code organization
   - Consistency
```

### For Authors

#### Submission Guidelines
```markdown
1. Change Size
   - Small, focused changes
   - Single responsibility
   - Clear boundaries
   - Minimal scope

2. Documentation
   - Clear descriptions
   - Updated docs
   - Example usage
   - Known limitations
```

#### Response Guidelines
```markdown
1. Feedback Handling
   - Professional responses
   - Timely updates
   - Clear explanations
   - Constructive discussion
   
2. Change Management
   - Track feedback
   - Organize updates
   - Document changes
   - Verify fixes
```

## Communication

### Feedback Style
1. **Constructive Comments**
   ```markdown
   Good:
   "Consider using a map here for O(1) lookup performance"
   
   Better:
   "The current array search is O(n). Using a map would improve lookup to O(1).
   Example:
   const lookup = new Map(items.map(item => [item.id, item]));"
   ```

2. **Clear Questions**
   ```markdown
   Good:
   "What's the rationale for this implementation?"
   
   Better:
   "I see we're using recursion here. Given the potential for stack overflow
   with large datasets, have we considered an iterative approach?"
   ```

### Response Patterns
1. **Addressing Feedback**
   ```markdown
   Good:
   "Fixed in latest commit"
   
   Better:
   "Implemented the suggested map approach in commit abc123. 
   Performance improved from O(n) to O(1) for lookups.
   Added benchmarks to verify improvement."
   ```

2. **Discussion Format**
   ```markdown
   Good:
   "I disagree with using a map here"
   
   Better:
   "While a map would provide O(1) lookup, in our case:
   1. Dataset is small (<100 items)
   2. Memory is constrained
   3. Array operations are more frequent
   Therefore, array implementation might be more appropriate."
   ```

## Best Practices

### Review Efficiency
1. **Time Management**
   ```
   - Regular review sessions
   - Focused attention
   - Timely responses
   - Reasonable scope
   ```

2. **Tool Usage**
   ```
   - Code review platforms
   - Automated checks
   - Linting tools
   - Documentation generators
   ```

### Quality Assurance
1. **Verification Steps**
   ```
   - Run tests locally
   - Check edge cases
   - Verify documentation
   - Test integration
   ```

2. **Security Checks**
   ```
   - Input validation
   - Authentication
   - Authorization
   - Data protection
   - Error handling
   ```

## Common Pitfalls

### Review Problems
1. **Scope Issues**
   ```
   - Too many changes
   - Multiple concerns
   - Unclear boundaries
   - Missing context
   ```
