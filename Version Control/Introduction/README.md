# Introduction to Version Control

## Overview
Version control systems (VCS) are essential tools in modern software development that track changes to files over time. They enable collaboration, maintain history, and provide mechanisms for managing different versions of source code and documentation.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Version Management
- Track changes to files over time
- Maintain a complete history of modifications
- Ability to revert to previous versions
- Compare changes between versions
- Tag specific points in history

### 2. Collaboration Features
- Multiple developers working simultaneously
- Change coordination and integration
- Conflict detection and resolution
- Code review capabilities
- Branch and merge workflows

### 3. Project Organization
- Repository structure
- Branching strategies
- Release management
- Documentation tracking
- Asset versioning
