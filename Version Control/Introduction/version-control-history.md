# History of Version Control Systems

## Early Version Control

### Manual Version Control (1950s-1960s)
- Paper-based tracking systems
- File naming conventions
  - Using dates in filenames
  - Numerical versioning
  - Manual logs and documentation
- Physical storage of code printouts
- Card deck management for mainframes

### Source Code Control System (SCCS) - 1972
- First formal version control system
- Developed by Marc Rochkind at Bell Labs
- Key features:
  - Single-file revision control
  - Delta compression storage
  - Exclusive file locking
  - Basic versioning capabilities
- Limitations:
  - Single user at a time
  - No networking capabilities
  - Unix-only platform

### Revision Control System (RCS) - 1982
- Developed by Walter Tichy
- Improvements over SCCS:
  - More efficient storage
  - Better performance
  - Easier to use
  - File locking mechanism
- Key features:
  - Local version control
  - Text file management
  - Branching support
  - Merge capabilities

## First Generation VCS

### Concurrent Versions System (CVS) - 1986-1990
- Based on RCS
- First collaborative version control system
- Key innovations:
  - Client-server architecture
  - Multi-user support
  - Directory structure handling
  - Network operation
- Notable features:
  - Concurrent access
  - Branching support
  - Tagged releases
  - Change logging

### Issues with Early Systems
1. **Technical Limitations**
   - File locking problems
   - Network performance
   - Storage inefficiency
   - Limited branching

2. **User Experience**
   - Complex commands
   - Poor conflict resolution
   - Limited merge capabilities
   - Difficult administration

## Second Generation VCS

### Apache Subversion (SVN) - 2000
- Designed to replace CVS
- Key improvements:
  - Atomic commits
  - Directory versioning
  - Better branching
  - Property support
- Notable features:
  - Track file renames
  - Binary file handling
  - Efficient storage
  - Better security

### Perforce - 1995
- Commercial version control
- Enterprise focus
- Key features:
  - High performance
  - Large repository support
  - Advanced branching
  - Strong security
- Notable capabilities:
  - Binary file management
  - Graphic tools
  - Integration options
  - Access control

## Distributed Version Control Era

### BitKeeper - 2000
- First widely used DVCS
- Used for Linux kernel development
- Key innovations:
  - Distributed architecture
  - Change sets
  - Pull-push model
  - Advanced merging

### Git - 2005
- Created by Linus Torvalds
- Response to BitKeeper licensing changes
- Key features:
  - Full distribution
  - Speed and efficiency
  - Data integrity
  - Branching model
- Revolutionary aspects:
  - Content tracking
  - SHA-1 checksums
  - Staging area
  - Flexible workflows

### Mercurial - 2005
- Developed by Matt Mackall
- Alternative to Git
- Key features:
  - Simple command set
  - Extension system
  - Web interface
  - Cross-platform support
