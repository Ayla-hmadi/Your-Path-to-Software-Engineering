# Other Version Control Systems

## Overview
While Git is currently the most popular version control system, several other VCS solutions offer unique features and advantages for specific use cases. Understanding these alternatives helps in choosing the right tool for particular requirements.

## Common VCS Types

### Centralized Systems
1. **Characteristics**
   ```

   - Perforce
   - CVS
   ```

### Distributed Systems
1. **Characteristics**
   ```
   - Multiple repositories
   - Complex history
   - Flexible workflow
   - Independent operation
   ```

2. **Examples**
   ```
   - Mercurial
