    - Container scan
    - Compliance check
```

## Access Control

### Pipeline Security
```yaml
Access Levels:
  - Read-only access
  - Developer access
  - Maintainer access
  - Administrator access

Controls:
  - Role-based access
  - Environment restrictions
  - Branch protection
  - Deployment gates
```

### Secret Management
```yaml
Secret Handling:
  Storage:
    - Vault integration
    - Environment variables
    - Encrypted secrets
    - Key management

  Best Practices:
    - Rotation policies
    - Access auditing
    - Encryption at rest
    - Secure transmission
```

## Security Scanning

### Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST)
```yaml

    - Hardcoded secrets
    - Insecure functions
```

### Dynamic Analysis Security Testing (DAST)
```yaml
dast_job:
  script:
    - deploy-test-env
    - run-dast-scan
    - analyze-results

  checks:
    - API security
    - Authentication
    - Input validation
    - Session management
```

### Container Security
```yaml

  actions:
    - Version checking
    - Vulnerability scanning
    - License compliance
    - Update automation
```

### Version Control
```yaml
version_control:
  security:
    - Branch protection
    - Signed commits
    - Review requirements
    - Merge restrictions

  checks:
    - Commit verification
    - Branch policies
    - Access controls
    - Audit logging
```

## Compliance and Audit

    - Security policies
    - Best practices

  standards:
    - SOC 2
    - ISO 27001
    - GDPR
    - HIPAA
```

### Audit Logging
```yaml
audit_configuration:
  logging:
    - Pipeline executions
    - Access attempts
    - Configuration changes
    - Deployment events

  retention:
    - Log storage
    - Backup policies
    - Access controls
    - Archive procedures
```

## Infrastructure Security

### Environment Security
```yaml
environment_security:
  controls:
    - Network segmentation
    - Access controls
    - Monitoring
    - Encryption

  environments:
    development:
      - Basic security
      - Development data
    production:
      - Enhanced security
      - Production data
```

### Cloud Security
```yaml
cloud_security:
  providers:
    - AWS security groups
    - Azure security center
    - GCP security command center

  controls:
    - IAM policies
    - Network security
    - Data encryption
    - Monitoring
```

## Incident Response

### Security Alerts
```yaml
alert_configuration:
  triggers:
    - Security violations
    - Policy breaches
    - Unusual activity
    - System failures

  responses:
    - Immediate notification
    - Automatic remediation
    - Incident logging
    - Team escalation
```

### Response Procedures
```yaml
incident_response:
  steps:
    1. Detection
    2. Analysis
    3. Containment
    4. Eradication
    5. Recovery
    6. Documentation
