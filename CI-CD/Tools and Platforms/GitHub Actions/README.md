# Introduction to GitHub Actions

## Overview
GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline directly from GitHub.

## Core Concepts

### Workflows
```yaml
# Basic workflow structure
name: CI Pipeline
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Build
        run: |
          npm install
          npm run build
```

### Components
1. **Events**
   ```yaml
   Events Types:
     - push
     - pull_request
     - schedule
     - workflow_dispatch
     - repository_dispatch
   ```

2. **Jobs**
   ```yaml
   Job Features:
     - Parallel execution
     - Dependencies
     - Conditions
     - Matrix builds
   ```

3. **Steps**
   ```yaml
   Step Types:
     - Actions
     - Shell commands
     - Script execution
     - Container commands
   ```

## Key Features

### Built-in Capabilities
```yaml
Core Features:
  - Matrix builds
  - Container support
  - Environment secrets
  - Artifact storage
  - Cache management
```

### Integration Points
```yaml
Integrations:
  - GitHub repositories
  - GitHub Packages
  - GitHub Security
  - GitHub Pages
  - Third-party services
```

## Workflow Examples

### Basic CI Pipeline
```yaml
name: CI
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm test
```

### Advanced Workflow
```yaml
name: Advanced CI/CD
on:
  push:
    tags:
      - 'v*'

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node: [14, 16, 18]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node }}
      - run: npm test

  deploy:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      - run: npm deploy
```

## Environment Configuration

### Secrets Management
```yaml
Secret Types:
  - Repository secrets
  - Environment secrets
  - Organization secrets

Usage:
  secrets.SECRET_NAME
```

### Environment Variables
```yaml
Variable Scopes:
  - Workflow-level
  - Job-level
  - Step-level

Definition:
  env:
    NODE_ENV: production
    API_URL: ${{ secrets.API_URL }}
```

## Action Types

### JavaScript Actions
```yaml
Structure:
  - action.yml
  - index.js
  - node_modules/

Features:
  - Fast execution
  - Node.js runtime
  - npm packages
  - TypeScript support
```

### Docker Actions
```yaml
Components:
  - action.yml
  - Dockerfile
  - entrypoint.sh

Benefits:
  - Custom environment
  - Tool installation
  - Platform support
  - Isolation
```

### Composite Actions
```yaml
Features:
  - Reusable steps
  - Multiple platforms
  - Shared logic
  - Version control
```

## Best Practices

### Workflow Design
1. **Organization**
   ```
   - Clear naming
   - Logical structure
   - Reusable components
   - Proper triggers
   ```

2. **Optimization**
   ```
   - Cache usage
   - Matrix builds
   - Job dependencies
   - Resource limits
   ```

### Security Considerations
1. **Access Control**
   ```
   - Minimum permissions
   - Secret management
   - Token rotation
   - Environment protection
   ```

2. **Code Safety**
   ```
   - Action pinning
   - Trusted sources
   - Code scanning
   - Dependency review
   ```

## Performance Optimization

### Build Speed
```yaml
Optimization Tips:
  - Cache dependencies
  - Optimize triggers
  - Parallel jobs
  - Minimal containers
```

### Resource Usage
```yaml
Resource Management:
  - Job timeouts
  - Concurrency limits
  - Build matrix
  - Artifact retention
```

## Common Use Cases
