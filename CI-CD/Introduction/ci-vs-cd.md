# Continuous Integration vs Continuous Delivery/Deployment

## Core Concepts

### Continuous Integration (CI)
```yaml
Definition:
  The practice of automatically integrating code changes
  from multiple contributors into a single software project

Focus:
  - Code integration
  - Build automation
  - Test execution
  - Early bug detection

Frequency:
  - Multiple times per day
  - Every commit
  - Regular intervals
```

### Continuous Delivery (CD)
```yaml
Definition:
  The practice of automatically preparing code changes
  for release to production, with manual deployment approval

Focus:
  - Release automation
  - Environment consistency
  - Deployment readiness
  - Manual triggers

Frequency:
  - After successful CI
  - Release cycles
  - Sprint completion
```

### Continuous Deployment (CD)
```yaml
Definition:
  The practice of automatically deploying code changes
  to production after passing all verification stages

Focus:
  - Automated deployment
  - Production reliability
  - Zero downtime
  - Automatic rollbacks

Frequency:
  - Every successful build
  - Multiple times daily
  - Automated triggers
```

## Process Comparison

### Stages and Activities

#### CI Process
1. **Code Changes**
   ```
   - Code commit
   - Branch management
   - Version control
   ```

2. **Build Process**
   ```
   - Compile code
   - Resolve dependencies
   - Create artifacts
   ```

3. **Testing**
   ```
   - Unit tests
   - Integration tests
   - Code analysis
   ```

#### CD Process (Delivery)
1. **Release Preparation**
   ```
   - Environment setup
   - Configuration management
   - Documentation
   ```

2. **Verification**
   ```
   - Staging deployment
   - UAT testing
   - Performance testing
   ```

3. **Manual Steps**
   ```
   - Release approval
   - Production deployment
   - Release verification
   ```

#### CD Process (Deployment)
1. **Automated Release**
   ```
   - Production deployment
   - Health checks
   - Rollback preparation
   ```

2. **Verification**
   ```
   - Smoke tests
   - Monitoring
   - Performance metrics
   ```
