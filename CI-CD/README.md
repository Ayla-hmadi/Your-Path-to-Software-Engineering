# Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment

## Introduction
CI/CD represents the backbone of modern software development practices, combining Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery/Deployment (CD) to automate and improve the process of software delivery. This automated pipeline approach ensures code quality, reduces risks, and enables rapid, reliable software releases.
