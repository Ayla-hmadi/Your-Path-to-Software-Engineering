    - Security scan findings
    - Technical debt

  Resource Usage:
    - CPU utilization
    - Memory consumption
    - Network bandwidth
    - Storage usage
```

### Alert Configuration
```yaml
Alert Types:
  Critical:
    - Pipeline failures
    - Security breaches
    - Resource exhaustion
    - Service outages

  Warning:
    - Long build times
    - Test flakiness
    - Resource pressure
    - Performance degradation
```

## Logging Architecture

### Log Categories
1. **Build Logs**
   ```
   - Compilation output
   - Build errors
   - Dependency resolution
   - Asset generation
   ```

2. **Test Logs**
   ```
   - Test results
   - Coverage reports
   - Performance metrics
   - Error traces
   ```

3. **Deployment Logs**
   ```
   - Deployment steps
   - Configuration changes
   - Service status
   - Health checks
   ```

### Log Structure
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T12:00:00Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "pipeline": "main",
  "stage": "build",
  "job": "compile",
  "message": "Build completed successfully",
  "metadata": {
    "duration": "145s",
    "artifacts": 3,
    "commit": "abc123"
  }
}
```

    notification:
      - slack
      - email

  Build Time:
    condition: duration > 30m
    severity: warning
    notification:
      - slack
```

### Notification Channels
```yaml
Channels:
  Slack:
    - Critical alerts
    - Team notifications
    - Status updates

  Email:
    - Daily summaries
    - Failure reports
    - Performance reports

  PagerDuty:
    - Critical failures
    - Service outages
    - After-hours alerts
```

## Log Management

### Retention Policy
```yaml
Log Retention:
  Build Logs:
    duration: 30 days
    storage: compressed
    archive: true

  Test Results:
    duration: 90 days
    storage: structured
    analysis: enabled

  Audit Logs:
    duration: 1 year
    encryption: enabled
    compliance: true
```

### Search and Analysis
```yaml
