# CI/CD Pipeline Overview

## Introduction
A CI/CD pipeline is an automated sequence of steps that handles the building, testing, and deployment of software applications. It serves as the backbone of modern software delivery, ensuring quality and reliability through automation.

## Pipeline Architecture

### Core Components
```yaml
Source Control:
  - Code repository
  - Version tracking
  - Branch management
  - Change history

Build System:
  - Code compilation
