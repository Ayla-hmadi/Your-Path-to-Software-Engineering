## Decision Framework

### 1. Initial Screening
```
Step 1: List all potential options
Step 2: Apply must-have criteria
Step 3: Create shortlist
Step 4: Detailed evaluation
```

### 2. Scoring System
```
Weight factors (1-5):
- Critical requirements: 5
- Important features: 3-4
- Nice-to-have features: 1-2

Score options (1-5):
5: Excellent match
4: Good match
3: Adequate match
2: Partial match
1: Poor match
```

### 3. Comparison Matrix
```
| Criterion          | Weight | Option A | Option B | Option C |
|-------------------|--------|----------|----------|----------|
| Performance       |   5    |    4     |    3     |    5     |
| Security          |   5    |    5     |    4     |    3     |
| Cost              |   4    |    3     |    5     |    2     |
| Support           |   3    |    4     |    3     |    4     |
| Weighted Total    |        |   75     |   68     |   65     |
