# Pair Programming

## Introduction
Pair programming is a software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One programmer, the "driver," writes code while the other, the "navigator," reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently.

## Core Concepts

### Roles

#### Driver
- Writes the code
- Focuses on tactical concerns
- Implements immediate solutions
- Handles the mechanics of coding
- Explains their thoughts while coding

#### Navigator
- Reviews the code
- Thinks strategically
- Spots potential issues
- Considers alternatives
- Provides guidance and suggestions

### Role Rotation
- Regular switching
- Equal participation
- Skill sharing
- Fresh perspectives
- Maintained engagement

## Benefits

### Code Quality
- Real-time code review
- Fewer bugs
