# Kanban Methodology

## Introduction
Kanban is a lean methodology for managing and improving work across human systems. Originally developed by Toyota for manufacturing, it has been successfully adapted for software development and knowledge work. Kanban focuses on visualizing work, limiting work in progress, and continuous flow.

## Core Principles

### Visualize the Work Flow
- Visual representation of work items
- Clear process states
- Work item tracking
- Bottleneck identification
- Progress transparency

### Limit Work in Progress (WIP)
- Explicit WIP limits
- Pull-based system
- Resource optimization
- Flow efficiency
- Queue management

### Manage Flow
- Continuous delivery
- Bottleneck elimination
- Process efficiency
- Value stream mapping
- Flow metrics

### Make Policies Explicit
- Clear process rules
- Definition of Done
- Service level agreements
- Quality standards
- Work item policies

### Implement Feedback Loops
- Regular meetings
- Performance metrics
- Process adjustments
- Continuous improvement
- Team collaboration

### Improve Collaboratively
- Evolutionary change
- Team involvement
- Data-driven decisions
- Incremental improvement
- Shared understanding

## Kanban Board

### Basic Structure
1. **To Do**
   - Incoming work items
   - Prioritized backlog
   - Ready for development

2. **In Progress**
   - Active work items
   - WIP limits applied
   - Current focus

3. **Done**
   - Completed work
   - Ready for delivery
   - Value realized

### Advanced Columns
- Backlog
- Analysis
- Development
- Testing
- Deployment
- Verification

### Swim Lanes
- Work type separation
- Priority levels
- Team assignment
- Service classes
- Expedited items

## Work Items

### Types

- Support Tickets

### Attributes
- Priority
- Size/Complexity
- Due Date
- Dependencies
- Assignment

### Cards
- Clear description
- Visual indicators
- Blocked status
- Time tracking
- Acceptance criteria

## Metrics and Measurements

### Lead Time
- Total time from request to delivery
- End-to-end cycle
- Customer perspective
- Value stream analysis
- Process efficiency

### Cycle Time
- Active work time
- Process efficiency
- Team performance
- Flow prediction
- Bottleneck detection

### Flow Efficiency
- Value-added time
