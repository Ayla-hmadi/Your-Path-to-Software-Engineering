# DevOps in Software Development Lifecycle

## Introduction
DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops), aiming to shorten the development lifecycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality. It represents a cultural shift that bridges the gap between development and operations teams.

## Core Principles

### Culture
- Collaboration over silos
- Shared responsibility
- Trust and transparency
- Continuous learning
- Blame-free environment

### Automation
- Continuous Integration
- Continuous Delivery
- Infrastructure as Code
- Automated testing
- Configuration management

### Measurement
- Performance metrics
- Error rates
- Deployment frequency
- Lead time
- Recovery time

### Sharing
- Knowledge transfer
- Best practices
- Lessons learned
- Tools and scripts
- Documentation
