# Agile Methodology

## Introduction
Agile methodology is an iterative approach to software development that emphasizes flexibility, customer collaboration, and rapid delivery of working software. Rather than following a linear path, Agile processes embrace change and continuous improvement through short development cycles called iterations or sprints.

## Agile Manifesto
### Core Values
1. **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
2. **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
3. **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
4. **Responding to change** over following a plan

### Twelve Principles
1. Customer satisfaction through early and continuous delivery
2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development
3. Deliver working software frequently
4. Business people and developers work together daily
5. Build projects around motivated individuals
6. Face-to-face conversation is the best communication
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress
8. Sustainable development pace
9. Continuous attention to technical excellence
10. Simplicity is essential
11. Self-organizing teams
12. Regular reflection and adaptation
