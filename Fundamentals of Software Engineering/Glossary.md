# Software Engineering Glossary

## A

**Agile**
A set of principles and practices that emphasize iterative development, collaboration, and adaptability to change. Agile methodologies prioritize customer satisfaction through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.

**API (Application Programming Interface)**
A set of definitions, protocols, and tools for building software. APIs define how different software components should interact.

**Abstraction**
The process of hiding complex implementation details while showing only the necessary features of an object or system.

## B

**Backend**
The server-side of an application that handles data processing, business logic, and database operations.

**Bug**
An error, flaw, or fault in a computer program that causes it to produce incorrect or unexpected results.

**Build**
The process of converting source code files into standalone software artifacts that can be run on a computer.

## C

**CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment)**
A set of practices that automate the process of software delivery, from integration of code changes to deployment to production.

**Code Review**
A systematic examination of source code intended to find and fix mistakes overlooked during development.

**Coupling**
The degree of interdependence between software modules; a measure of how closely connected two routines or modules are.

## D

**DevOps**
A set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to shorten the development lifecycle while delivering features, fixes, and updates frequently and reliably.

**Design Pattern**
A general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design.

**Documentation**
Written text or illustrations that accompany software to explain how it works or how to use it.

## E

**Encapsulation**
The bundling of data with the methods that operate on that data. Encapsulation is used to hide the values or state of a structured data object inside a class.

**End-to-End Testing**
Testing approach that evaluates the flow of an application from start to finish to ensure the system works as intended.

**Environment**
The setup in which a software system is deployed and run (e.g., development, staging, production).

## F

**Framework**
A platform for developing software applications that provides a foundation on which software developers can build programs.

**Frontend**
The client-side of an application that users interact with directly.

**Function**
A self-contained block of code that accomplishes a specific task.

## I

**IDE (Integrated Development Environment)**
A software application that provides comprehensive facilities for software development.

**Inheritance**
A mechanism that allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class.

**Integration Testing**
Testing in which individual software modules are combined and tested as a group.

## K

**Kanban**
A visual framework used to implement agile that promotes small, continuous changes to your current system.

## L

**Legacy Code**
Source code inherited from someone else or from an older version of the software.

**Library**
A collection of pre-written code or resources that can be reused in software programs.

## M

**Microservices**
An architectural style that structures an application as a collection of small autonomous services.

**Middleware**
Software that acts as a bridge between an operating system or database and applications.

**MVP (Minimum Viable Product)**
A version of a product with enough features to satisfy early customers and provide feedback for future development.

## O

**OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)**
A programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects" that can contain data and code.

## P

**Polymorphism**
The ability of different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through base class inheritance.

**Production**
The "live" version of an application that end-users interact with.

## R

**Refactoring**
The process of restructuring existing computer code without changing its external behavior.

**Repository**
A storage location for software packages, often version-controlled.

**REST (Representational State Transfer)**
An architectural style for providing standards between computer systems on the web.

## S

**Scrum**
An agile framework for managing knowledge work, with an emphasis on software development.

**SDK (Software Development Kit)**
A collection of software development tools in one installable package.

**Sprint**
A fixed time period during which specific work has to be completed and made ready for review.

## T

**Technical Debt**
The implied cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy solution now instead of using a better approach that would take longer.

**Test Case**
A set of conditions under which a tester will determine whether a system works as intended.

**TDD (Test-Driven Development)**
A software development process relying on software requirements being converted to test cases before software is developed.

## U

**Unit Testing**
A level of software testing where individual components of a software are tested.

**UX (User Experience)**
The overall experience of a person using a product such as a website or computer application.

## V

**Version Control**
A system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that specific versions can be recalled later.

**Virtual Machine**
An emulation of a computer system that provides the functionality of a physical computer.

## W

**Waterfall**
A linear sequential approach to software development where progress flows steadily downwards through phases.

**Web Services**
A standardized way of integrating web-based applications using open standards over an Internet protocol backbone.

## Note
This glossary is continuously updated as new terms and concepts emerge in the field of software engineering. Terms are added and modified based on industry developments and feedback from the development community.
